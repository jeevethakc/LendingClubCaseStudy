## General Information
This company is the leading online platform for loan marketplace, offering personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical expenses. Borrowers can conveniently access loans at lower interest rates through a fast and user-friendly online interface.

Similar to other lending institutions, the primary source of financial loss for this company comes from lending to risky applicants, resulting in credit losses. Credit loss refers to the amount of money a lender loses when a borrower fails to repay or defaults on the loan. In other words, borrowers who default cause the most significant financial losses for lenders. In this context, customers labeled as 'charged-off' are the ones considered as 'defaulters.'

By identifying high-risk loan applicants, the company can reduce the number of such loans, thereby mitigating credit losses. The goal of this case study is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify these risky applicants.

The company aims to understand the key factors (or driver variables) that lead to loan defaultsâ€”specifically, the variables that are strong indicators of default. This insight can be leveraged by the company for better portfolio management and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
Borrowers with 10 years of employment tenure have highest percentage of loan defaults, possibly
due to higher loan amounts or other financial commitments.

Borrows with employment tenure 1,2 and 3 years also contribute significantly to loan defaults due
to job instability or lower income levels.

Borrowers with 7+ years of employment (excluding 10 years) have relatively lower default rates,
likely due to consistent income.

Loan purposes related to higher financial risks (like small business or education) are more likely
default compared to purposes like weddings or home improvement, which might involve smaller
or more manageable loans.

Loans that are verified have slightly higher percentage of defaults compared to those that are
source-verified or not verified. This suggests verification alone may not reduce default rates.

Default rates increase as the loan grade worsens, with grade A loans having the lowest default
rates and grade G loans the highest. This indicate a strong correlation between loan grades and the
likelihood of default.
